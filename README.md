1. Go to File->New Project->Version Control->Git in RStudio  
2. Under "Repository URL", paste this in: https://github.com/versipellis/KaggleWinterBeaverCTR  
3. This is the Github link to the repo

2. To pull from the repo, go to Tools->Version Control->Pull Branches  

**Git Commit & Push**  
1. Save the file you're working on  
2. Go to Tools->Version Control->Commit (Shortcut is Control+Alt+M on Windows)  
3. Tick the "Staged" box next to the file you want to commit and push to the repo  
4. Commit the changes with a somewhat descriptive message so others know what you did  
5. Click on the Push button to push the files you changed, sitting in your staging area, to the repo
